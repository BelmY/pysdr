A python-based software-defined radio (SDR) framework designed for extremely rapid development of computationally intensive SDR apps, with an emphasis on utilization of mature 3rd party packages/libraries

Bokeh is used for the GUI, although you are free to use anything you want (e.g. matplotlib)

VOLK with python wrappers can be used as a faster alternative to numpy

All apps created with this framework are automatically web-based thanks to Flask

Get started with:

0. Connect an RTL-SDR
1. `[sudo] pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. `python bokeh_rtl.py`
3. A web browser should pop up, showing the FM radio spectrum
